Git has 3 areas:
The Working Directory: the space where you make changes and work normally.
The Staging Area: the files that you want to add are there.
The Repository: the git folder (the local repository) that will update with the online one (the online repository).

- Put or change the user locally:
git config --global user.name "your-name"
git config --global user.email "your-email"
git config --global list --> It will list your configuration.


- Clone a repository:
git clone URL
git clone URL "directory name"

- Create an empty local repository or add git to a current one:
git init --> To add git to an existing project.
git init project-name

- Create a remote origin to a new repository:
git remote add origin url --> It connects your local wih the remote repository creating an origin.

- Add files to the staging area:
git add . --> The dot (.) will add all the files not tracked.
git add file-name

- Commit changes to the local repository that are in the staging area:
git commit --> It will open the default editor to write the changes on the commit.
git commit -m "Text" --> -m means "message".
git commit -a -m "Text" --> 

- Push the changes to the online repository:
git push origin main --> Where "origin" referes to the GitHub repository name and "main" to the branch we want to commit the changes.


- See the difference in files that are not added to the local respository:
git diff file-name

- See the history commit changes:
git log
git log --oneline --> Shows an abridged version of the log history (one line per commit).

- Remove a file from the staging area:
git rm --cached file-name

- Move to a previous or next version of a file or commit that is on the local repository:
git checkout file-name
git checkout commit-id
git checkout main --> It goes to the last commit.

- Revert all the changes made on the last commit making a new commit:
git revert commit-id 

- Create a new branch:
git branch name
git checkout -b name --> Creates a new branch and take you there.

- Moving between branches:
git checkout branch-name

- List all the branches:
git branch -a

- Delete a branch:
git branch -d name
git push origin --delete name --> Deletes a branch and push the changes to the online repository.

- Merge a branch in the current branch:
git merge branch-name

- Update your local repository with the online repository changes.
git pull --> It will pull everything that is in the already connected online repository.
git pull origin branch --> Specifically pull the code of the bracnch inputed.
git pull origin main --> I will pull everything from the online repository.
