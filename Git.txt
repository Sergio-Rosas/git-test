Git has 3 areas:
The Working Directory: the space where you make changes and work normally.
The Staging Area: the files that you want to add are there.
The Repository: the git folder (the local repository) that will update with the online one (the online repository).

- Put or change the user locally:
git config --global user.name "your-name"
git config --global user.email "your-email"
git config --global list --> It will list your configuration.


- Clone a repository:
git clone URL

- Create a local repository:
git init project-name

- Add files to the staging area:
git add file-name

- Commit changes to the local repository that are in the staging area:
git commit -m "Text" --> -m?

- Push the changes to the online repository:
git push origin main --> Where "origin" referes to the GitHub repository name and "main" to the branch we want to commit the changes.
